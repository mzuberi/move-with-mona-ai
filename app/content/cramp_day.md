# Cramp Day Flow – Soft but Strong (30 min)

This is your go-to flow when you’re on your period, feeling low energy, or just need to move gently but effectively. Soft transitions, deep core support, and breath-led movements. You’ll end feeling grounded, soothed, and strong.

“You’re allowed to move gently. Movement is medicine.”
